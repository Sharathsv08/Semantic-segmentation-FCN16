# Semantic-segmentation-FCN16

I have used FCN16 architecture in order to perform semantic segmentation. The 
dataset includes 961 images with corresponding mask annotated images. 
Annotation is done manually for all the images.
Segmentation is essential for image analysis tasks. Semantic 
segmentation describes the process of associating each pixel of an image with 
a class label, (such as flower, person, road, sky, ocean, or car).
Semantic Segmentation is a classic Computer Vision problem which involves 
taking as input some raw data (eg., 2D images) and converting them into a mask 
with regions of interest highlighted. Semantic Segmentation, which clusters parts of images together which belong 
to the same object on interest, solves this problem, and thus finds applications in 
myriad fields.Obtained an accuracy of 94%.
